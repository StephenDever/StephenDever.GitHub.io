						</header>
						<p>In my spare time I like to refurbish and restore bikes to their former glory. I started doing it because as a commuter and racer on a budget it was important to me to know as much about my equipment as possible so I could maintain everything and fix malfunctions. Add to that an interest in vintage raod bikes and suddenly I have a dozen project bikes in my basement. Things haven't changed much from when I was growing up in the late 90s. Back then it was difficult for my family to afford a computer, but my interest and fascination with them didn't stop me from learning all about them and eventually building my own out of parts. By the mid 2000s I was building and selling computers during summer breaks from college and no longer relied on employment for income. In college I studied political science because I wanted to know about the world, but I majored in mathematics because I wanted to learn a solid skill that would always give me an edge with whatever field I decided to go into.</p>
						<p>After using my math degree to teach for several years I decided to learn a new skill and change career paths to application and web developemnt. Over the past 2 years I've become a full stack developer with proficiency in C#, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuerry, and Python. I have experience working with Visual Studio 2008, 10', 12', 13', and 15'; as well as MVC 4/5, bootstrap, Entity Framework, .NET Framework, and Agile/Scrum project life cycle methodology/management. I regularly employ version control with Git, and coding best practices (a must in any team environment!). Besiudes a background in pure and applied mathematics and teaching, I have extensive experience with management and scheduling.</p>
						<p>Of the languages I've learned, I really enjoy SQL for how straight forward it is and the nature of database requests being very rigorous. On the other hand, I appreciate C# for its virtually endless functionality and code libraries. At the end of the day I have a soft spot for Python because it's a dynamically typed language, and that freedom when interacting with variables can be kind of liberating compared to strongly typed languages. I'm really looking to join a team where my skills can be put to good use and I can continue to learn and grow as a developer.</p>

						<h3>But why male road bikes?</h3>
						<p>These are all pictures I've taken of project bikes and personal bikes. I rescue what I consider interesting bikes and refurbish them. I have a particular eye for road racing bikes. I'm currently working in my spare time toward building an MVC site that I'll use with a database to showcase all my project bikes, complete with pictures, video, history, and parts information. </p>
